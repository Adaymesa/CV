## Who is Aday Mesa?

I am a junior software developer, future dad and also a traveller who is eager of knowledge and new challenges. I am positive minded, flexible and emphatic. Code wise, maintainability and simplicity are my two best friends, always followed by the industry best practices. I believe in lifelong learning as a way of life. I am not seeking for just a job, I am looking for the opportunity to bring value and keep learning. **I am available 1st July, 2016**.

## Skills

**I work well in teams.** <br />
I feel really comfortable working with more people. For the Makers Academy final project, I was part of a four-person team where everyone felt involved and got to know every part of the project. To achieve it we used a strong agile approach and version control tools as GitHub and Waffle. Having 2 weeks to finalise the project, we had our MVP deployed in Heroku within 4 days.

**I am relentless.** <br />
I am a hard-worker and highly motivated person. Many people call me crazy, but I have been able to work 30 hours a week a the same time of doing a boot camp as MA. Is not something to be proud, but I have done it! 

**I adapt easily.** <br />
During the last 2 years I have lived and worked in 3 different countries, met a lot of new people and the luck to submerge in their culture. Also during the 7 months that I was living in Brussels I have been hosting travellers in my house, sharing breakfast, lunch or dinner with people from different countries, cultures, backgrounds, races or ethnics. And the best of it, I LOVED IT!

**I learn fast.** <br />
I have worked in the final project for MA with technologies that I never used before, and in a language that I started to learn the 3 weeks previously. Also I have been able to grasp so many concepts weekly, which has converted me in a sort of devourer of knowledge.
